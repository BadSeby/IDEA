#Introduction
Differential expression analysis
Package Introduction

#Basic Information
In IDEA, a raw count table should be uploaded and experiment design be clarified. Optionally, experiment design can be one of Standard Comparison, Multi-factors Design and Without Replicates (not recommended). Then a pair of conditions should be selected to carry out differential expression analysis.   
In these case, experiment design was stated as **`r plist[[1]][1]`**. And 
**`r as.character(plist[[1]][[2]])[1]`** and **`r as.character(plist[[1]][[2]])[2]`**
were selected for differential expression analysis.

#Analysis Result
##Differential Expression Table
After analysis, a table containing information of all diffientially expressed genes is presented with interactive options. Implication of nouns in header is explained in Table 1.
Note that in different packages, same noun in header can have different implication. For example, *p*-values in DESeq are obtained by Wald test, but in edgeR *p*-values are obtained by Fisher's exact test.

##Variance Estimation
The variance estimates plot is for checking the result of dispersion estimates adjustment. Specifically, in DESeq2, variance estimation is plotted by executing ```plotDispEsts()``` which is built-in in the package.
The gene-wise estimates are in black, the fitted estimates are in red, and the final estimates are in blue. The outliers of gene-wise estimates are marked with blue circles and they are not shrunk towards the fitted value. The points lying on the bottom indicates they have a dispersion of practically zero or exactly zero.   
<div align="center">
```{r results="hide", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#insert DESeq2 plotting code here!
plotDispEsts(plist[[2]])
```

##MA-Plot
A MA-Plot can give a quick overview of the distribution of data. The log2–transformed fold change is plotted on the y-axis and the average count (normalized by size factors) is on the x-axis. The false discovery rate (FDR) threshold can be interactively changed, and the genes are colored red if the adjusted p-value is less than the FDR, while other genes are colored black.    
In this case, FDR threshold was set as ```INPUT THRESHOLD HERE!```.
<div align="center">
```{r results="hide", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
print(plist[[3]])
```

##Normalized Size Factors
Different samples may have different sequencing depth. In order to be comparable, it is necessary to estimate the relative size factors of each sample, and divide the samples by the size factors separately.    
Table of normalized size factors shows the normalized size factors of each sample. In the header, *Group* represents conditions, *lib.size* represents size of the library, *norm.factors* is the normalized size factors.

##Volcano Plot

An overview of the number of differential expression genes can be shown in the *volcano plot*. The log2-transformed fold change is on the x-axis, the y-axis represents the–log10-transformed *p*-value. The threshold of *p*-value is ```INPUT THRESHOLD HERE!```, and fold change threshold is ```INPUT THRESHOLD HERE!```. Highly differential expressed genes are colored blue, while others are in red.

```{r results="hide", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
print(plist[[4]])

```

##Heatmap of Differential Expressed Genes

Heatmap can display the expression values of the features, and every rectangle represents one gene-sample pair. Features are arranged in columns (samples) and rows (features) as in the original data matrix. The color represents $log_{10}(Normalized Reads Count + 1)$.   
<div align="center">
```{r results="hide", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#heatmapO[[1]]  data
#heatmapO[[2]] a logical vector with two elements 
#heatmapO[[3]] scalling method
#heatmapO[[3]] legend options
heatmapO=plist[[5]]
pheatmap(heatmapO[[1]], color=redgreen(75),border_color=NA,cluster_rows=heatmapO[[2]][1],cluster_cols= heatmapO[[2]][2],scale=heatmapO[[3]],legend=heatmapO[[4]])
    
```

##FDR Distribution Plot

FDR distribution plot visualizes distribution of FDR in differential expression test. In DESeq2, **Wald test** is adopted. It uses FDR as x-axis and percentage of different groups of x value as y-axis, and colors significant and not significant groups differently.   
Note that FDR distribution plot is not available in NOISeq package, since probabilities in NOISeq are not equivalent to *p*-values.
